        <h2 class="sub-heading">Create The Best Design</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="post-text">Figma is a leading design software, helping teams and individuals create designs faster and more efficiently. Figma is free and you can use it right on your web browser, on Mac, and on Windows.

            The course has a practical component that takes you step-by-step through the workflow of a professional app designer. From user flow diagrams to wireframing to mockups and prototypes.
            
            Students completing the course will have the knowledge to create beautiful and lovable apps that leave people with a smile on their faces.
            
            The UI/UX Design With Figma Course is great for people with absolutely no design experience or experienced designers who want to get up to speed quickly with mobile app design and web design. We'll explore key UI and UX concepts that are essential to building good-looking and easy-to-use apps that are loved by users.
            
            The only apps that do well are ones that are well designed both in terms of user interface and user experience. That's why it is so important to learn the design skills that will make your app stand out in a crowd.
            
            Using the latest best practices in Web Design and Mobile Design as well as User Interface and User Experience Design (UI/UX), this course focuses on efficiently getting you from zero to a point where you can get hired or win freelance contracts. We will use in-demand tools like Figma to show you a full workflow from start to finish.</p>

        <p class="post-text">Figma is a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool that is often used for UI design.

            We just published a 10-hour Figma course that will teach you how to use the tool for UI design.
            
            Joseph Brendan developed this course. Joseph is a great instructor who has taught thousands of people on his YouTube channel.</p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">How to Create Your First UI Design App in Figma</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="post-text">As creators or developers, we all have a billion-dollar idea that requires a billion-dollar app to solve users’ problems. But how do you test and validate your app idea using design? With Figma, this is possible because you can design, prototype, and collaborate on your design with your potential uses.

                In this tutorial, you’ll work on an app where users can order groceries and have them delivered within 10 minutes at their location. Normally, before designing an app like this, you’d need to do user research and a market survey. This is the user experience (UX) design side of building a business idea. Then, after the research, you’d design the app based on the research result you have. This aspect is the user interface (UI) design. In this post, we’ll focus on the UI side of things by designing the app home screen.</p>
